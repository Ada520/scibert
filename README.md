# <p align=center>`SciBERT`</p>
`SciBERT` is a `BERT` model trained on scientific text. It results into state-of-the-art performance on a wide range of scientific domain nlp tasks. 

* `SciBERT` is trained on papers from the corpus of [semanticscholar.org](semanticscholar.org). Corpus size is 1.14M papers, 3.1B tokens. We use the full text of the papers in training, not just abstracts.

* `SciBERT` has its own vocabulary (`scivocab`) that's built to best match the training corpus. We trained a cased and an uncased version. We also include models trained on the original BERT vocabulary (`basevocab`) for comparison.

* It results into state-of-the-art performance on a wide range of scientific domain nlp tasks. Evaluation code and data are included in this repo. 

### Downloading Trained Models
We release the tensorflow and the pytorch version of the trained models. The pytorch version is created using the [Hugging Face](https://github.com/huggingface/pytorch-pretrained-BERT) library.  All combinations of `scivocab` and `basevocab`, `cased` and `uncased` models are available below. Our evaluation shows that `scivocab-uncased` usually gives the best results.
